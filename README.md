# drug-induced-autoimmunity
This project explores machine learning techniques to predict drug-induced autoimmunity using molecular descriptors. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (KNN, ANN, SVM, and ensemble methods), hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation with cross-validation and external validation.
